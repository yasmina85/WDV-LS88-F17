CCN: 46820
Instructor: Yasmin AlNoamany

## Course Description

The course introduces students to Web science with a focus on how the Web works, types of Web data, and how to generate effective visualizations for Web data (e.g., social networks). The course covers basic principles and tools for understanding and visualizing Web data. It focuses heavily on project work that aims to give students hands-on experience with handling Web data.

Because Web science is interdisciplinary by nature, this course connects students to different disciplines such as social science, computer science, and information science. At the end of the course, students should be able to apply Web mining techniques on and draw insights from real-world data.

## Late policy:
Late assignments lose 1 points for every 24 hours they are late. Students should contact the instructor if they have an excuse. No assignment will be accepted more than 7 days late.

## Attendance:
Attendance is required for class participation and discussion. Contact instructor prior to the class if you have a reason for the absence. 

## Participation
Participation will in the form of the discussion in the class and/or questions or comments on required readings of the previous week. There will be a discussion forum for each week readings on bCourses. Students are supposed to submit their comments/questions on readings as a reply to the discussion.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty
We encourage collaboration and working in teams. However, homework assignments should be completed independently. You can discuss assignments with others with mentioning that at the bottom of your assignment. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.

## Seeking Help:
If you have questions, first check the course Web site. Feel free to ask in the class, or post your question on bCourses. There will be office hours on Tuesdays, from 3:00-4:00 pm. If students can not make it to the office hours, they can schedule an appointment by email: yasminal@berkeley.edu.

## Disability accommodations:
If you experience a disability which will impact your ability to access any aspect of the class, please contact me and check out the university policy of accommodating special needs from here: http://www.dsp.berkeley.edu/accommodationpolicy
